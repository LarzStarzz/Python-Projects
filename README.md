# Python_Sorting_Algorithms

Anneliese Larson
M3 | Project 1: Sorting Algorithms

This code is used to test the time complexitys of several differnt sorting alorithms which include Insertion, Bubble, Merge, Quick, and Radix sort. Each algorithm was tested using differnt size data sets from 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, and 10,000,000 ranging from integers of 0 to 2,147,483,647.

All functions which perform each algorithm are named as such, a few have supporting function with a comment to which algorithm it belongs to. Aditional supporting functions include timing, and the creating of the random generated datasets. 

User Guide:
When running these tests some algorithms take longer than others. For this we have this section which you will comment and uncomment which desired algorithms to test.
